  <a href="/"><h1>Spyfall Rules</h1></a>
  <p>After roles are dealt out via PM, the GM will roll a dice to determine who asks the first question (Each subsequent round, the player who was the spy the previous round will start the round, as they would deal role cards normally), players can ask one another questions, with the intention of confirming the location. "Hey Mike, what do you think of the food here?" "I love it! I brought my own meals, after all!" The goal is to ask questions or give answers that hint you know where the team is, without giving away so much information that the spy can guess where they are, while trying to figure out who the spy is when their answers don't quite sync up with the theme. The only rule for questions is that you cannot ask a question to the same person that just asked you (no tagbacks!).</p>

  <h2>How to win</h2>
  <p>First off, the spy, at any time, can reveal they are a spy and try and guess the location. If they are correct, they win! Otherwise, the players win. </p>

  <p>
Additionally, at any time, or after the round end timer goes off, any member can accuse a player of being a spy by making a post, in bold, along the lines of I believe ____ is a spy. When this happens, the questions and answers are paused, and a vote is made to see if every other player agrees with the accusation. When voting, each player may also give a reason for their vote, or any other statement they may like. These votes do not count towards the post limit, if a reveal doesn't happen, the round resumes where it left off. In a mid-round vote every player must agree unanimously for the accusation to stand, at which point the player is revealed. If they are a spy, the team wins, if not, the spy wins. </p>

  <p>If the game makes it to the 24 hour timer, the spy still may come forward before end-game voting is called to guess the location, at which point the same rules apply. Similarly, during the final 24 hours, players can still accuse a spy and call an early vote. Once the final bell rings and players are called to vote, however, it is too late for the spy to win by guessing the location. During this final vote, voting is private, done by PM, and cannot be changed. The player with the most votes is revealed, if they are a spy, the team wins. If they are not, the spy wins!</p>
